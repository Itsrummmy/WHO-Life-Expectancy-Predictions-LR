<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
## Project Overview

Project involved building two linear regression models to predict life expectancy using a dataset from 2000 and 2015. The first model is designed to prioritize accuracy, while the second is simplified to focus on ethical considerations.

<!-- Outcomes -->
## Outcomes

* The test RMSE for both models (robust and ethical) were 0.557 and 1.619 (7 months and 1 year, 9 months) respectively.
* The ethical model was primarily based on just two features: adult mortality and infant deaths.
* The ethical model emerged as our preferred choice for predicting life expectancy due to its demonstrable lack of bias, , and aligning with all our ethical considerations.

<!-- Conclusion -->
## Conclusion

This project effectively delivered two predictive linear regression models and an interactive function for estimating life expectancy, prioritizing both accuracy and ethical standards. The accuracte model demonstrated superior predictive performance with a lower RMSE, while the ethical model provided a privacy-focused alternative. These results highlight the capability of data-driven approaches to deliver impactful, ethical, and scalable solutions in the realm of public health.
